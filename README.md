Alien Invasion is a 2D space shooter game built using Python and the Pygame library. Inspired by classic arcade games like Space Invaders, players must defend Earth from waves of alien invaders by controlling a spaceship and shooting down enemy ships.

## Features

- **Player-controlled spaceship**: Use arrow keys to move left and right.
- **Challenging waves**: As you progress, enemies become faster and harder to defeat.
- **Score tracking**: Keep track of your score as you destroy alien ships.
- **Lives system**: The game ends when you lose all your lives (default is 3).
- **Multiple levels**: Each level increases in difficulty with faster-moving aliens.
